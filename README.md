# ext2-filesystem-reader
ext2 filesystem reader, written purely in Java

This was a term-project for module 'Operating Systems' at Lancaster University.

The program has no GUI.

1. To see contents of the file system, enter the desired path when prompted. The output is similar to the 'ls -al' command of
a UNIX-like system. The difference is, when the user inputs the path to a file and not a directory, the output will be the
contents of the file.

2. To exit the program, the user can type, 'end', 'exit', 'quit' or 'stop'.
